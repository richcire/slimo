This is a simple app that you can save/delete your todo or memo through input bar and boards.

Each board represents its elements status.

Board on left shows you things you've done.

Board on center shows you things you're currently focusing on.

Board on right shows you thing you'll do later.

Once a todo or memo is added through input bar, it initially apepars on center board in the form of square label.

Each label is draggable toward other board you want to move label to.

You can also delete one through button inside label.
